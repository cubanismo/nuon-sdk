This is a demonstration of how overlays
can be written. It also contains some
useful utility routines for doing DMA
to/from arbitrary addresses (see dma.s)
and an overlay loader (see overlay.s).
The main test program is test.a; it
loads two sets of overlays. The first
set of overlays is found in func1.s,
the second in func2.s.
