Slide Show Instructions
-----------------------

The slide show begins in Automatic mode, and will run by itself.

To take control, hit the STOP button on the remote. Then you are in
Manual mode, and can run the show as follows:

    RIGHT --- next slide      (can use ENTER instead)
    LEFT ---- previous slide

    UP ------ next song
    DOWN ---- previous song

    PLAY ---- return to Automatic mode

You can also go to a specific slide, or hear a particular song, by
using its index number from the Table of Contents. By keying in a
number, you can also change the number of seconds each slide stays on
screen in Automatic mode.

To key in a number, for example, 25: press and release the 2, then
press and release the 5. With the number keyed in:

    RIGHT --- go to the specified slide (can use ENTER instead)
    UP ------ go to the specified song 

    PLAY ---- resume Automatic mode with new Viewing Time per slide

For indexed slides or songs, the number must be in range, or the
command will be ignored. So if you ask to go to song 25 and there are
only 15 songs, nothing will happen.

Changing the Viewing Time per slide should always work, although the
you probably can't go any faster than 3 seconds per slide. But large
numbers are fine: for example, keying in 60 and pushing PLAY will
restart Automatic mode with each slide being shown for one minute.
