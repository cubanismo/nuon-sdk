<h4><u>Slide Show App -- overview</u></h4>

<p>The slide show app is offered as a customizable tool for producing
slide shows based on JPEG images and, optionally, MIDI music files.
The sample can be built as is, and will demonstrate such a slide
show. Of course, what's interesting is the possibility of
substituting your own image and music files, and the documentation
strives to clearly explain the steps for doing just that.</p>

<p>A good place to start is in the doc folder, with the <a
href="doc/UsersGuide.html"> User's Guide</a>. This will explain how the
slide show behaves to a user -- starting in a fully-automatic playing
mode, but allowing entry to a manual mode with controls for random
access to slides or MIDI files, or sequential access (forward or
backward) for each. One can restart the automatic slide show with the
PLAY button, optionally with a new viewing-time per slide.</p>

<p>If this sounds intriguing, try building and running the sample
slide show.  cd to the build directory and type "gmake"; this will
produce a NUON.CD file that gets copied to the release directory,
which also contains the <a href="release/TableOfContents.html">
Table of Contents</a> for this particular slide
show. Burning the NUON.CD file onto the root directory of a blank
CD-R will allow you to play the show on an N501 or later NUON DVD
player.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> the loading process on the N501 takes about a minute, and
toward the end of it, the screen display may be partially overwritten
with "hash". This is harmless, and just means that the frame buffer,
containing the on screen image, has been overwritten by the loaded
application. In a few seconds you'll see the warning splash screen,
and can hit ENTER on the remote to begin.</p>

<p>Actually building your own slide show will require careful reading
of the <a href="doc/AuthorsGuide.html"> Author's Guide</a> in the doc
folder, and reasonable comfort with command-line interactions --
though not much more than you needed to type "gmake" and build the
sample slide show. Certainly you don't have to be a programmer; what's
required is patience for following directions, and a willingness to
ask for help if you get into difficulties.</p>

<p>Finally, enthusiastic programmers may wish to study the code in
the build and utils directories and make improvements in the slide
show's capabilities. Or, they may be inspired to put a GUI front end
on the entire process, which could simplify the operation
enormously.</p>


<h4><u>Slide Show App -- confessions</u></h4>

<p>We agree that building a slide show should be carried out through
graphical operations, such as dragging JPEG and MIDI files into
target windows, filling out a dialog box to select options, and
firing off the whole operation with one final mouse-click on a "build
slide show" button. In fact, one of the check-box options should
include burning a blank CD-R with the finished NUON.CD file, assuming
the hardware is there to support it. We hope to supply such a GUI
front end in a subsequent release, though it's possible that someone
out there will beat us to it with a much better job than we could do.</p>

<p>The <a href="doc/AuthorsGuide.html">Author's Guide</a> gives a
detailed discussion of coping with the possible need to squeeze the
slide show into a 4.5MB NUON.CD file. This need seems quite
ludicrous -- the machine will read that file from a 650MB
CD-R and then ignore all the other real estate on the same disc! This
is one of those "historical" (hysterical?)  problems that will soon
get fixed, but we didn't want to hold up release of the NUON SDK on
that account.</p>

<p>How serious a limtitation is this?</p>

<p>The sample slide show, with 33 pictures and 5 MIDI selections, is
well within the limits referred to; another slide show I made had
twice as many images and nearly two-hours of MIDI accompaniment. A
third slide show, without MIDI, had 103 pictures and could have
handled more. All images referred to are at the "high resolution"
setting of 480-lines; there is also a 240-line setting you can choose,
in which the practical number of images goes up by about a factor of
four. </p>

<p>So, you ought to be able to get something interesting up while
waiting for a less restrictive version to arrive.</p>

<p>Lastly, it remains to acknowledge the bare-bones nature of the
slide show app. It was thrown together in a few weeks and lacks
amenities such as title screens, crossfades, thumbnails with
navigation capability (as in DVD menus), and on-screen confirmation
of keypad entry, particularly for entering numbers that are used for
navigation and resetting the per-image viewing time.</p>

<p>Shortcomings aside, we hope that you can have some fun with this, as
we ourselves have done.</p>
