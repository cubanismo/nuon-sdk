<h2>Slide-Show App: Author's Guide</h2>

<p>
Here is the checklist of the steps involved, with full
explanations following:

<OL><font color="blue">
<LI><!-- item 1 -->
Edit the "user.dat" file in the Slide-Show directory, to specify
the behavior of your slide show (e.g., whether or not there will be
background music).

<LI><!-- item 2 -->
Prepare a set of JPEG images (method described below), and copy
the prepared JPEG files to the Slide-Show\jpegfiles subdirectory.

<LI><!-- item 3 -->
Create a file "jpegfiles.lst" in the Slide-Show directory, that
lists the JPEG files in the desired viewing order.

<LI><!-- item 4 -->
If there is to be music, prepare a set of MIDI files (method
described below), and copy them to the Slide-Show\midifiles
subdirectory. 

<LI><!-- item 5 -->
Following step 4, create a file "midifiles.lst" in the Slide-Show
directory, that lists the MIDI files in the desired playing order.

<LI><!-- item 6 -->
cd into the Slide-Show\build directory and type "gmake". This will
produce a NUON.CD file, whose size is required to be under 4.5MB. If
it is larger, an iteration will be necessary, as described below.

<LI><!-- item 7 -->
Optionally, create a Table of Contents, to allow the user to
summon up any image or MIDI file by index when in Manual mode.

The <a href="#conclusion"><b>Conclusion</b></a> section below talks
about packaging your slide show for distribution, either
electronically or on physical media.

<h2>Detailed discussion of the checklist steps</h2>

<h3>1. Editing the "user.dat" file</h3>

<p>
This file, found in the Slide-Show directory, allows specification of
three parameters that define the slide show behavior. This file will
be incorporated into the Makefile at build time, and so must follow
Makefile syntax -- notice the use of the # sign for comment lines.
Careful editing of this file should involve changing exactly three
numbers, two of which can only have the values 0 or 1.

<p>
Here is the file in question:

<pre><font color="blue"># SlideShow app configuration data. Edit only as directed.

# for MIDI playback, set MIDIPLAY to 1. Set it to 0 for no MIDI playback.
MIDIPLAY = 1

# for 480-line images, set HIRES to 1. For 240-line images, set it to 0.
HIRES = 1

# specify the number of seconds to hold each image onscreen
VIEWTIME = 10
</font></pre>

<p>
As it appears, MIDI file playback is called for, and the Synth will
be linked into the final application. If you don't wish to use MIDI,
change the line

<pre><font color="blue">MIDIPLAY = 1
</font></pre>

<p>
to 

<pre><font color="blue">MIDIPLAY = 0
</font></pre>

<p>
This will prevent the Synth from being linked, which will make more
room for images.

<p>
The second decision involves viewing resolution. The default is to
show the images at 480 lines (i.e. 480 pixel resolution in the
vertical direction). Images prepared for this size will take about
2.5 seconds to decode, limiting the rapidity with which they can be
advanced. At 240 lines, the images are smaller and can be decoded in
about 0.5 seconds. In Manual mode, it will be striking how much
faster the new image paints itself over the old one.

<p> The problem with 240-line images is that they don't look as good
as the 480-line ones, but with many images the results may still be
satisfactory. The advantage, of course, is that you can fit about
four times as many images within the same 4.5MB limitation.

<p>
If the goal is to have several hundred images, and medium quality is
acceptable, then opt for low resolution, and change

<pre><font color="blue">HIRES = 1
</font></pre>

<p>to 

<pre><font color="blue">HIRES = 0
</font></pre>

<p>
in "user.dat".

<p>
Finally, the slide show will come up in Automatic mode, where each
image is held on-screen for a fixed viewing time, and then advanced
to the next image, endlessly cycling through the entire series. The
default shown above (VIEWTIME = 10) is reasonable for the demo slide
show of 33 images -- it translates to a cycle time for the whole show
of 33 x 10 = 330 seconds or five and a half minutes. With a very
small number of images, say fewer than 10, one might prefer longer
viewing time per image, say 20 seconds or more. If there are lots of
images, a shorter viewing time might be preferred, the practical
limits being 3 seconds for 480-line images, and 1 second for the
240-line images.

<p>
The value you set is the viewing time per image with which the slide
show will begin; it can always be changed by the user, by entering
Manual mode and then keying in a new viewing time before resuming
with the PLAY button.

<p>
<b>Note:</b> this value is an integer, so don't use a decimal point
anywhere (e.g. 4.5 is illegal: pick 4 or 5).


<h3>2. Preparing the JPEG images</h3>

<p>
JPEG images, without processing, will not display satisfactorily on
the TV. A pair of utility programs -- ana480.exe and ana240.exe --
have been provided in the Slide-Show\utils directory to make the
necessary conversion, and it may be convenient to copy these
executables to another directory that already lies in your PATH.

<p>
These programs will accomodate source images of fairly arbitrary
sizes and proportions; images that are tall or wide, relative to the
TV's 4 by 3 aspect ratio, will be centered in a black background. The
programs also stretch the images horizontally to compensate for the
non-square pixels of the TV; images should therefore look correct on
the TV, while the processed JPEG files will look slightly elongated
if viewed on the PC.

<p>
If you have selected HIRES = 0, then you'll use ana240.exe and
produce 240-line final images. If you've selected HIRES = 1, then
you'll work with ana480.exe instead. I'll assume the latter for
illustation, below.

<p>
ana480.exe is a command-line utility that expects two arguments, the
second of which is optional and will be discussed in Section 6. The
first is a text file that lists your JPEG originals, each JPEG
filename necessarily starting in the first column. Such files are
used in several places during preparation of the slide show -- let me
call them "list files". Here is an example of such a file, called
"jpegs.lst":

<pre><font color="blue">; a few pictures from my trip

c:\trip\PIC00034.JPG
d:/photos/summer_01/freds_cat.jpg  ; a fine animal!

; the next one was taken by Molly
sunset.jpg
</font></pre>

<p>
Notice that the semicolon (;) can be used for entering comments,
which may even occur on a line following the filename. Blank lines
can be inserted at will. The referenced JPEG files can be located
anywhere on your system, through the use of fully-qualified names
(specifying drive letter and directory hierarchy); either forward or
backward slashes can be used for the directory separators.
Unqualified names -- such as "sunset.jpg" on the last line -- are
assumed to live in the current directory. 

<p>
The format is therefore flexible, but note that each filename must
appear on its own line, and it must start in the first column!

<p>
If it so happens that all the relevant JPEG files are in the current
directory, then a quick method is available for generating the list
file: simply type the command

<pre>
    dir /B *.jpg > jpegs.lst
</pre>

<p>
This lists the JPEG files, one per line. You would then edit this
file to reflect the viewing ordering you prefer. 

<p>
Given a listfile, created by whatever means, ana480 is invoked upon
it by the command line:

<pre>
    ana480 jpegs.lst 
</pre>

<p>
and it will produce the converted JPEG files. In this example, with
three original files, the output will consist of precisely three
files named nuon_001.jpg, nuon_002.jpg, and nuon_003.jpg. The
association is based on the ordering of files in "jpegs.lst":

<pre>
    c:\trip\PIC00034.JPG ------------------> nuon_001.jpg
    d:/photos/summer_01/freds_cat.jpg -----> nuon_002.jpg
    sunset.jpg ----------------------------> nuon_003.jpg
</pre>

<p>
The original files are not altered; the nuon_xxx.jpg files are
created in the current directory, and are suitable for use in the
slide show application. These are the files to be copied to the
Slide-Show\jpegfiles directory, using drag-and-drop in
the Windows Explorer, or by a command such as

<pre>
    copy nuon_???.jpg \vmlabs\sample\Slide-Show\jpegfiles
</pre>

<p> Note the explicit form <tt><b>nuon_???.jpg</b></tt> for the source
files; this is to avoid copying your originals as well, which would
happen if they reside in the same directory and the simpler
<tt><b>copy *.jpg ...</b></tt> is used.


<h3>3. Creating the "jpegfiles.lst" file in the Slide-Show directory</h3>

<p>
Once the nuon_xxx.jpg files are in the Slide-Show\jpegfiles
directory, you can create the "jpegfiles.lst" in the Slide-Show
directory by a simple method. At the command line, cd to the
Slide-Show directory and type

<pre>
    dir /B /ON jpegfiles\*.jpg > jpegfiles.lst
</pre>

<p>
The /B asks for a "basic" listing, with only the filenames (no dates
or sizes); the /ON requests alphabetic ordering, to make sure that
your file comes out with the contents looking like

<pre>
    nuon_001.jpg
    nuon_002.jpg
    nuon_003.jpg
</pre>

<p>
and so on, for as many files as there are. Since the numerical
ordering created by the ana480 (or ana240) executable corresponds to
the preferred ordering as specified in your original list file, that
is the ordering you wish to preserve here.


<h3>4. Preparation of MIDI files</h3>

<p>
This is much simpler than preparation of the JPEG files. The NUON
Synth requires that its MIDI files be in Format 0. If you know that
your MIDI files are Format 0, then no further steps are required;
they will work as they are.

<p>
Many MIDI files are in Format 1, and these will not work with the Synth.
(They won't sound wrong -- they just won't sound at all!) One of the
utilities in the vmlabs\bin folder is mergemf.exe, which exists just
for the purpose of converting Format 1 MIDI files to Format 0. It is
invoked from the command line: for example,

<pre>
    mergemf OriginalFile.mid NewFile.mid
</pre>

<p>
will create NewFile.mid as a Format 0 version of OriginalFile.mid.
This works even if OriginalFile.mid happens to be a Format 0 file;
the operation is then unnecessary, but harmless. Do it if you're not
sure -- the original file is unaltered as long as the output filename
is different or specified in a different directory.

<p> The final Format 0 MIDI files must be placed in the
Slide-Show\midifiles directory, and you can copy them there after
running the conversions shown above. If it simplifies things, you can
use the mergemf tool to place each converted MIDI file there
directly, with invocations like

<pre>
    mergemf MyFile.mid c:\vmlabs\sample\Slide-Show\midifiles\MyFile.mid 
</pre>

<p>
Substitute the correct path to the midifiles directory, if it's
different on your machine.


<h3>5. Creating the "midifiles.lst" file in the Slide-Show directory</h3>

<p>
This can be done in many ways, but one convenient approach is to cd
to the Slide-Show directory and type

<pre>
    dir /B midifiles\*.mid > midifiles.lst
</pre>

<p>
The resulting "midifiles.lst" file will probably want editing in
which you move the lines around to define the performance ordering.
This is a list file, and so blank lines and comments (following a
semicolon) are allowed. For example, the "midifiles.lst" file for the
sample slide show reads:

<pre><font color="blue">;;; An all-Bach recital

; from the Well Tempered Clavier, Book II
fugue_15_book2.mid   ; harpsichord

LittleGMinorFugue.mid   ; Clarinet (mostly: Tuba for low notes)

; From the Musical Offering
Ricercare_3.mid ; voiced for violin, recorder, and harpsichord

fugue_10.mid    ; the only two-voice fugue in the WTC

PassacagliaAndFugue.mid ; on the accordion!
</font></pre>

<p>
Of course, you might have created this file entirely manually,
starting with a list of known MIDI file names and deciding in advance
what ordering works best.


<h3>6. Building the app</h3>

<p> At this stage, you're ready to build the NUON.CD file. cd to
the Slide-Show\build directory and fire off the command

<pre>
    gmake
</pre>

<p>
That is normally sufficient, even when rebuilding after making
changes, but there is here an unusual exception: after any change to
the contents of the Slide-Show\jpegfiles or Slide-Show\midifiles
directories, it is necessary to invoke

<pre>
    gmake clean
</pre>

<p>
<b>before</b> invoking <tt>gmake</tt> to rebuild NUON.CD.

<p> Once NUON.CD is built, it is important to make note of its size.
If it is over 4.5MB (about 4,700,000 bytes -- here mega is 1024^2,
not 10^6), then reduction is in order. The first thing to try is
revisiting step 2, on the creation of the nuon_xxx.jpg files.  These
were made with a command line like

<pre>
    ana480 jpegs.lst
</pre>

<p>
which is actually equivalent to typing

<pre>
    ana480 jpegs.lst 95
</pre>

<p>
The second, optional, argument is the JPEG quality factor, and
controls the degree of compression in making the nuon_xxx.jpg files.
The quality factor is an integer in the range 0 to 100; the default
value of 95 is a high quality setting, and higher values would result
in larger file sizes with improvements that could probably not be
detected on a TV monitor.

<p>
Make a note of the collective size of the nuon_xxx.jpg files, say by
typing 

<pre>
    dir nuon_???.jpg
</pre>

<p>
which reports the cumulative byte size. Now delete those files

<pre>
    del nuon_???.jpg
</pre>

<p> (<b>caution:</b> not<tt> "del *.jpg"</tt> which could clobber your
originals!) and try again with a smaller value of the quality factor,
e.g.

<pre>
    ana480 jpegs.lst 80
</pre>

<p>
Check the new cumulative byte size, and see if the reduction is what
you need. Let me illustrate with round numbers, just to make it easy
to follow. Say your original NUON.CD file is 5,000,000 bytes. This is
too big by about 300,000 bytes, which is the trimming down you need
to achieve by lowering the quality factor. 

<p>
Suppose (again, using round numbers) that the original nuon_xxx.jpg
files show a cumulative size of 3,800,000; we need to bring it down
to 3,500,000 or less. The idea is to find the highest quality setting
that achieves this, and a few experiements are all you need.
Remember, the original (default) quality factor was 95. Suppose that
by trying 80 you get a total size of 2,800,000 -- this is well under
3,500,000 and suggests trying again with a higher quality factor.
Perhaps using 90 gives a total size of 3,600,000 -- just a tad too
big. Now try 88 or 89 and you'll be there. Better to be under than
right on the button, since NUON aligns the files and this introduces
a small amount of padding.

<p>
On one slide show with 103 images (at 480-lines) and no MIDI, I had
to go to a quality factor of 75. The results might have shown
degradation on a good computer monitor, but on the TV they looked
fine. 

<p>
If the method just described is insufficient, and you really want to
keep all the images in the slide show, then there are two
alternatives. The first is to abandon MIDI accompaniment (assuming
you've been using it). The MIDI files aren't the problem -- hours of
MIDI come in very small MIDI files -- but the General MIDI wavetable
data of the NUON Synth is by itself 1.5MB. Setting MIDIPLAY = 0 in
"user.dat" gives you back more than that amount of space for image
files.

<p>
The other alternative is to switch to low resolution mode (HIRES = 0
in step 1). Depending on the kind of images you're using, viewing at
240-line resolution might be quite acceptable. Remember that you have
to change the HIRES setting to 0 and reconvert the JPEG originals,
this time using ana240.exe:

<pre>
    ana240 jpegs.lst
</pre>

<p>
Hopefully you don't have to start lowering the quality factor here!

<p>
<b>Reminder:</b> after copying the reduced nuon_xxx.jpg files
to the Slide-Show\jpegfiles directory, be sure to invoke 

<pre>
    gmake clean
</pre>

<p>
before rebuilding NUON.CD.


<h3>7. Creating the Table of Contents</h3>

<p>
You may use the list files as a starting point, but the idea is to
produce a numbered list of both images and music so that
the user can go directly to a desired selection in Manual mode.

<p> The <a href="../release/TableOfContents.html">Table of
Contents</a> for the sample slide show is found in the release
folder, and will serve as a complete example.

<a name="conclusion">
<h2>Conclusion: putting it all together for release</h2>

<p> At the end of the build, the NUON.CD file is copied to the
release folder. Along with the <a href="../release/QuickInstructions.html"> 
Quick Instructions</a> and your <a href="../release/TableOfContents.html"> 
Table Of Contents</a> file, this folder then contains the essentials you 
need to distribute your slide show.

<p>
Electronic distribution is simplest -- for example, ZIP the contents
of the release folder and attach a note about burning NUON.CD onto
the root directory of a blank CD-R.

<p>
If you make the CD-Rs yourself, you might want to print an insert
that includes the instructions and your Table of Contents. The
<a href="../release/QuickInstructions.html"> Quick
Instructions</a> document is intentionally brief, but the alternative
text below is briefer, and may be a better choice if space is
limited. It simplifies the explanation by stating explicitly the
allowable ranges for picture and MIDI file index:

<pre><font color="blue">    To control the slide show manually, hit STOP.

    To go to a particular slide, key in its number (1 to 33) and hit
    ENTER (or RIGHT). 

    To go to the next slide, just hit ENTER or RIGHT. To get back the
    previous slide, hit LEFT.

    To go to a particular song, key in its number (1 to 5) and hit
    UP. 

    To go to the next song, just hit UP. To restart the previous
    song, hit DOWN.

    To restart the slide show, hit PLAY.

    To restart the slide show with a different viewing time per
    slide, key in the desired number of seconds per slide and then
    hit PLAY. For example, 6 - 0 - PLAY gives you one minute per 
    slide.
</font></pre>

<p>
This uses the number of slides and MIDI files from the sample; <b>put
your own numbers in place of these</b>. In the absence of MIDI, the
obvious deletions can be made from the above or from release folder's
<a href="../release/QuickInstructions.html">Quick Instructions</a> document.
