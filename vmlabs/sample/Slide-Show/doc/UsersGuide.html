<h2>Slide-Show User's Guide</h2>

<p>
The Slide Show does not require any assistance from the user, once it
has begun. The slides automatically advance through the entire
series, each slide being held on-screen for a predetermined number of
seconds, called the Viewing Time. After the last slide has finished,
the process begins again with the first, endlessly cycling through
the entire sequence.

<p>
If there is musical accompaniment, the individual MIDI selections
also proceed automatically, the next one beginning after the current
one has ended. As with the slides, when all have been played, the
cycle begins again.

<p>
To control the slide show directly, press the STOP button on the
remote:

<pre>
    STOP:   end Automatic mode, enter Manual mode
</pre>

<p>
This should freeze the slide show at the current picture.
Unfortunately, there is no direct confirmation that the STOP key has
been "heard" (next version!), but waiting a few seconds should settle
the issue. The slide show is now in Manual mode.

<p>
In Manual mode, the musical accompaniment will continue as before,
with automatic sequencing from each selection to the next. Music
remains on Automatic in all cases, though it can be controlled in the
same manner as slides. Here are the buttons that do the job:

<pre>
    ENTER or RIGHT: show the next slide
    LEFT:           show the previous slide
    UP:             play the next musical selection
    DOWN:           play the previous musical selection

    PLAY:           resume Automatic Mode
</pre>

<p>
If the author has provided a Table of Contents, or Index of the slide
and musical selections, then it is possible to go directly to a given
choice by keying in its index, as illustrated by this example.
Suppose the Table of Contents contains the following:

<pre>
    Pictures
    --------
    1. George Washington Bridge
    2. Mom and Dad packing the suitcase
    3. ...
    ...
    25. Aunt Ella in her garden
    26. Jackie's cat

    Music
    -----
    1. Maple Leaf Rag
    2. ...
    ...
    7. Theme from Raiders of the Lost Ark
    8. Excerpts from Koyaanisqatsi (Glass)
</pre>

<p>
Then in Manual mode you could go directly to "Aunt Ella in her
garden" by using the numeric keys to enter 25 (press 2 and release
it, then press 5 and release it), and then pressing ENTER (or RIGHT).

<p>
Here, 25 is a numeric PREFIX that modifies the way the ENTER key
behaves: normally, that key (or the equivalent RIGHT key) advances to
the next slide; but if a numeric PREFIX is detected, then it is taken
as the index of the slide you want to see.

<p>
One catch: the index must be in the allowable range or it will have
no effect. In the example shown here, there are 26 slides, so the
PREFIX must be within the range 1 to 26. If you key in 30 and push
ENTER, nothing will happen -- just try again with a valid number.

<p>
The UP key, which normally advances to the next musical selection, is
likewise modified by a numeric PREFIX. In this example, pushing 1
followed by UP will always start up Maple Leaf Rag, regardless where
you happen to be at the moment.

<p>
Finally, the numeric PREFIX is useful for changing the Viewing Time.
As mentioned above, pressing PLAY when in Manual mode returns you to
Automatic mode, with the slide show advancing automatically at the
previous Viewing Time per slide. But a numeric PREFIX entered before
hitting PLAY will set a new Viewing Time: for example, keying in 6 -
0 - PLAY will restart the slide show with each slide being held for
one minute (60 seconds).


<h3>Final note: use of the control keys in Automatic mode</h3>

<p>
It is possible to use the remote keys while the slide show is in
Automatic mode, though it may work very poorly if the Viewing Time is
only a few seconds. That is because the program spends time decoding
the slide images, and is not attentive to the remote control while
that's going on. Thus, the response may be irratic and frustrating.

<p>
If the Viewing Time is large -- say 15 seconds or more -- then
pressing RIGHT (or LEFT) will probably take you to the next (or
previous) slide. You may even be able to enter a PREFIX and go
directly to an indexed slide, from which the slide show will then
continue. But this can misfire, if you're too close to the point
where the next slide is being prepared for viewing. 

<p>
Although keys can be missed in Automatic mode, the STOP key will
always be detected; at worst, you have to wait a couple of seconds
while it finishes decoding the slide it was preparing (and will now
ignore once it's done). Then you're back in Manual mode, where you
can be sure it pays full attention to the remote control.

<p>
There is generally no drawback to using the UP and DOWN keys while in
Automatic mode: you know right away if it worked, since the music
should stop and the next (or previous) selection begin. If it
doesn't, just hit the key again.
