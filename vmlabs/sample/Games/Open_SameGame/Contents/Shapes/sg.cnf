# TILE SIZE: Bigger tiles mean nicer more detailed artwork; however,
# they also mean fewer rows and columns of tiles.  For example, the
# Colors version of SameGame uses 31x31 pixel tiles which give a 6x9
# game.  The Balls version of SameGame is 10x15 which gives the
# gameplay more depth; but it is played with 18x18 pixel tiles, hence
# the sphere artwork.  The Shapes version is also 15x10, but we have
# increased the screen and source size and this has cost us in slower
# frame rate.

# The width in pixels of the tiles; since they are assumed square
# this is also the height of the tiles.

# MATS: A mat is a picture which is uncovered when the tiles are
# removed.  A game can have between 0 and 10 mats.  The are loaded
# into SameGame at run time and one is chosen at random at the start
# of a game.  If the player successfully clears all the tiles from
# the table then a different mat is chosen for the next game.  The
# mats are located in Mat0.tga to Mat9.tga.  These tga files must be
# 288x192.  The picture used will probably be smaller (exact
# dimensions given below in MAT_WIDTH and MAT_HEIGHT), so position
# the picture in the tga file so that the upper left corner is at
# (0,0).

TGA_WIDTH 448

# ANIMATION: After highlighting a group and pressing A, an animation
# sequence plays.  The tiles which make up the animation are found in
# animate.tga, which *must* be a 352x272 pixel picture.
#
# The tiles are arranged in rows from left to right with a one pixel
# border surrounding them.  The order of the rows depends on the order
# of the tiles in tiles.tga.  Have a look at one of the provided
# examples to completely understand the setup. Since each sequence
# must be in a row, the width of animate.tga limits the number of
# tiles in the animation sequence; for example, the max number of
# tiles is 10 if the tiles are 31x31.

# number of steps (tiles) in the animation sequence; set this
# to 0 (zero) if there is to be no animation;  max number of
# steps is 10
NUM_ANIM_STEPS 0

# TRANSPARENCY IN TILES: In the Shapes version of SameGame, part of
# the tiles are transparent so that one can see the background
# between the balls; whereas, in the Colors version the tiles are
# a solid colour and completely cover up the background.  (See
# below on how to set the transparency colour.)  Set the below to
# 1 if you want to see some of the background through parts of the
# tiles; otherwise set it to 0.
TILE_TRANSPARENCY 1

# TRANSPARENT COLOUR : As we are not using alpha channels but still
# wish to have transparency in some of the artwork (probably at least
# the game cursor will have need of transparency), we designate one
# colour for which ReadTGA will substitute kBlackff.  Note that
# tga files must be indexed, thus we give up one colour to get the
# transparency.

# For POKE the colour is (182, 226, 61) and for BALLS, SHAPES, and
# COLORS it's (126, 126, 124).

# TITLE SCREEN: The tile screen consists of a background picture and
# two pointers which allow the player to select one of the options.
# The main options are: Play, Level, Demo, and Exit.  As well Level
# has three options: Normal, Challenge, and Super Challenge.
# Pressing the A button on Play or Level will start the game at the
# level of play currently designated.  Pressing Demo will start a
# computer=player version of either Normal or Super
# Challenge. (Challenge gets mapped to Super Challenge.)
#
# Currently I use the same blit for both pointers, but they can
# be different.
