Within the Contents directory we find the sounds and artwork files
needed to play SameGame.  For example, both the Colors and Shapes
directories contain the artwork, sound, and configuration files needed
to play that particular flavor/version of SameGame.
</p>

<p align="left">
The artwork files which *must* be present are: background.tga,
extra.tga, tiles.tga, and title_pic.tga.  If the game uses mats, each
of these is stored in Mat0.tga, Mat1.tga, Mat2.tga, etc.  If the game
uses animation then animate.tga must be present. See <a
href="Readme.Art">Readme.Art</a> for details about artwork.
</p>

<p align="left">
As well, each of the Colors and Shapes directories *must* contain a
configuration file sg.cnf.  The configuration files for Colors and
Shapes are different.  They are heavily commented and the various
different SameGame features are explained.

</p>

<p align="left">
SameGame looks for the following sound files: click.raw,
changetile.raw, bigdelete.raw, bigdeleteall.raw, bonus.raw, and
nobonus.raw.  If SameGame can't find or load one of these files, it
will not try to play it during the game.  Thus a particular sound
effect can be effectively turned off by removing the corresponding
.raw file from the directory.  See <a href="Readme.Snd">Readme.Snd</a>
for details about sound.
</p>

<p align="left">
SameGame also has the capacity to animate a group just before it
disappears. To add animation, create the necessary artwork in
animate.tga, which must be a 352x272 pixel picture and set the
NUM_ANIM_STEPS variable in sg.cnf appropriately.  More information is
found in <a href="Readme.Ani">Readme.Ani</a>.  Colors SameGame has
animation.  Animation is an optional feature for SameGame.
</p>

<p align="left">
To create a new version of SameGame you will need to have at least the
four artwork .tga files plus a configuration file.  (Mats and sound effects
are nice too, but the game will run without them.)  The sg.cnf files
accompanying the Shapes and Colors versions of SameGame are heavily
commented and so can act as a prototype for any new configuration file.
</p>

<p align="left">
Once you have all the files you need, you must create a datafile
sg.dat using the Cat_files tool found in the CreateDataFile directory.
The file <a href="Readme.Dat">Readme.Dat</a> gives a quick overview
and <a href="CreateDataFile/README">CreateDataFile/README</a> gives
instructions on how to do this.
</p>

<p align="left">
Once you have a datafile, copy it up into the directory containing all
the source code.  Type  make  to create sg.cof.  Both the Colors and the
Shapes version of SameGame come with a ready made datafile.

      file, artwork, and sounds required to play the Shapes version of
      SameGame.  Shapes SameGame has a much larger playing field than
      Colors and so probably provides more challenging gameplay.  Having
      a larger playing field forces the tiles to be smaller and the
      artwork to be simpler.  Shapes SameGame does not have background
      pictures; indeed the tiles have areas of transparency and it is
      possible to view the gray background behind the tiles.</td>
