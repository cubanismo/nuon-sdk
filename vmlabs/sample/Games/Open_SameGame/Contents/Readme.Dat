SameGame can now read art, config, and sound files out of a single
data file.  The name (and path if necessary) of this data file is
defined in DATA_FILE in sg.h.  It's usually defined to be sg.dat.  To
switch between reading art and sounds from the Contents folder (or
whatever path is giving in sg.cnf) and reading art and sounds from a
data file, change the value of USE_DATA_FILE in sg.h.

Note: if running SameGame from a CD-RW or CD-R, one must use a
data file.

These data files are created by the program Cat_files which stores a
list of files (each file padded with zeros so that it's size is a mult
of 2K, where 2K is one sector on a DVD) in output.dat; as well as, an
Index of these files.  The module xtract.c and xtract.h contains
functions which can access data files created by Cat_files and which
can extract files from it.  These xtract ftns have been incorporated
into SameGame.


Currently I store the files in sg.dat in following order:

sg.cnf, Mat*.tga, background.tga, extra.tga, tiles.tga, 
title_pic.tga, animate.tga, *.raw

Order probably isn't that important, though it might be good to have
the Mats near the beginning of the dat file as SameGame will be
looking for them over and over again.
