<p align="left">Welcome to SameGame, a simple yet mesmerizing game where you delete 
  groups of tiles for points. The larger the group, the more points you earn! 
  Removing all the tiles on the screen wins you a bonus too! </p>
<p align="left">A group is two or more tiles of the same design or colour which 
  touch on either the left, right, top or bottom. Deleting a group causes the 
  images above that group to drop down, forming new groups. If you find these 
  last two sentences confusing, watch SameGame in Demo mode and all well become 
  clear to you! </p>
<p align="left">SameGame has three levels of play. In Normal mode you have 3 different 
  types of tiles; whereas, Challenge and Ultimate modes have 4 different types 
  of tiles. Since playing with 4 different tiles is much trickier than with 3 
  tiles, Challenge mode starts you off with two special tiles (randomly placed) 
  which are switchable; this will help you in your quest to clear the entire screen! 
</p>
<p align="left">If you are using the joypad, use the D-pad to move your cursor 
  over the various groups and press A to delete the highlighted group. Pressing 
  B when pointing at a special tile changes that tile. Pressing Start will exit 
  the current game or demo. </p>
<p align="left">If you are using the IR remote, use the Enter button to delete 
  the highlighted group, use the Exit button to change a special tile, and press 
  Play to exit the current game or demo. Use the Up/Down or Left/Right to move 
  your cursor.</p>

<p>To Compile SameGame:</p>
<ol>
  <li> There are two versions of SameGame: Colors and Shapes. Set the Makefile 
    variable GAME_TYPE to COLORS or SHAPES depending on which version you would 
    like to build. The makefile will then copy either Contents/Colors/sg.dat or 
    Contents/Shapes/sg.dat to this directory. (sg.dat is a data file for SameGame 
    which contains a config file as well as all artwork and sounds.) By default, 
    the SHAPES version will be used.</li>
  <li> Type "gmake". This should produce sg.cof, cd_app.cof and NUON.CD. (Type 
    "gmake clean" to remove all those pesky .o files.)</li>
</ol>

<p>To Run SameGame:</p>
<ol>
  <li> To play SameGame on your NUON N501 player you must: 
    <ul>
      <li>Using your own CD writer software on a personal computer, write NUON.CD 
        to the root directory of a CD-R or CD-RW. "Root directory" means the top 
        directory. NUON.CD cannot be inside any other directory or folder on the 
        CD. The disc must use the ISO9660 disc format. Joliet extensions are not 
        required but will work OK. </li>
      <li>Place the newly written CD-R or CD-RW into your NUON player. </li>
      <li>After NUON.CD has loaded, you will see an message screen. Press A or 
        Enter to load Colors SameGame. Press B or Exit to quit. (If you are using 
        the IR remote, use the Enter or Exit button. If using the joypad, use 
        the A or B button.)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>To play SameGame on your developer system, type &quot;gmake load&quot;.</li>
</ol>
