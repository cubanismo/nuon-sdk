<p align="left">Welcome to SameGame, a simple yet mesmerizing game where you delete 
  groups of tiles for points. The larger the group, the more points you earn! 
  Removing all the tiles on the screen wins you a bonus too! </p>
<p align="left">A group is two or more tiles of the same design or colour which 
  touch on either the left, right, top or bottom. Deleting a group causes the 
  images above that group to drop down, forming new groups. If you find these 
  last two sentences confusing, watch SameGame in Demo mode and all well become 
  clear to you! </p>
<p align="left">SameGame has three levels of play. In Normal mode you have 3 different 
  types of tiles; whereas, Challenge and Ultimate modes have 4 different types 
  of tiles. Since playing with 4 different tiles is much trickier than with 3 
  tiles, Challenge mode starts you off with two special tiles (randomly placed) 
  which are switchable; this will help you in your quest to clear the entire screen! 
</p>
<p align="left">Use the D-pad to move your cursor over the various groups and 
  press A to delete the highlighted group. Pressing B when pointing at a special 
  tile changes that tile. Pressing Start will exit the current game or demo.</p>

<p>Known Problems:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Currently it takes a minute or two to load up the game. You will see some 
    flickering as the game loads, before the main menu is displayed.</li>
</ul>
<p>To make SameGame run from a DVD, do the following:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Compile SameGame with ON_DVD set to 1 (this turns off the printf statements 
    amongst other things) </li>
  <li>Copy the following to the /udf/nuon directory on the DVD: 
    <ul>
      <li>sg.cnf</li>
      <li>SameGame.cof, renamed as nuon.run or as appropiate. </li>
      <li>Contents directory</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Update the PATH variable in /udf/nuon/sg.cnf to the path of the directory 
    containing the artwork and sounds, i.e. "/udf/nuon/Contents/Flowers/". </li>
</ol>
