<p align="left">This program demonstrates how the video overlay channel can be
used.</p>

<p align="left">The program creates three screen frame buffers.&nbsp; Two are
used to double-buffer the main video channel.&nbsp; The third buffer is used for
an overlay video channel.</p>

<p align="left">The program draws a simple graphics display into the main video
channel.&nbsp; This consists of a few colored lines that cross from one side of
the screen to the other.</p>

<p align="left">For the overlay channel, the program draws only text.&nbsp; The
overlay channel's frame buffer is initialized to use an alpha channel value that represents complete
transparency, so that it is invisible and you see through it to the main
channel.&nbsp; Then the text is drawn using a different alpha channel value that
makes it opaque.&nbsp; Finally, a portion of the text is animated so that the
alpha channel value is changed frame by frame to make it slowly fade away.</p>

<p align="left">The text in the overlay channel is only redrawn when something
is changing, such as the animation.&nbsp; The rest of the time, it is not
necessary to redraw the text every frame because the changes to the graphics in
the main channel do not affect the overlay channel.</p>

<p align="left">This example does not double-buffer the overlay channel.&nbsp;
However, there is no reason why an application could not do so if desired.</p>
