There is help available from within theprogram. The main demos are as follows:</p><p><ol>  <li> <tt>Raytrace 1:</tt> One of the first demos ever written for NUON. This     demonstrates real time raytracing. Ray tracing (not ray casting) is a computationally     intensive process which allows for spectacular graphics effects such as reflections     and shadows. All of the objects in this particular demo are modeled as spheres.   </li> <li>  <tt>Raytrace 2:</tt>  A second real time raytracing demo, which adds polyhedra (the ground  plane and the VM Labs logo box) and an in-scene light source. </li> <li>  <tt>Mandelbrot:</tt>  An interactive fly-through of the Mandelbrot set. Every pixel is recalculated  from scratch on every frame. In fact higher performance could be achieved  by caching values and re-using them; but that would require much more  sophisticated (and larger) code, and this early demo was designed to be  very small. </li></ol><p></p><p>All of these demos were originally designed to fit within the internalmemory of the MPEs, so they had to work with only 4K of code and 4K ofdata. (In fact the original version of Raytrace 1 ran in lessthan 1K of code!). Hence they are small, and deliberately very simple.</p><p> Also of interest is that none of these demos have bitmaps -- even the VM Labs   logo in the Raytrace 2 demo is generated procedurally. The only bitmap in this   demo is the font (which is from the <tt>libterm</tt> library). </p><div align="center">  <center>    <table border="1" width="500" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="4">      <tr>         <td width="50%"><b><font color="#000080">Filename</font></b></td>        <td width="75%"><b><font color="#000080">Description</font></b></td>      </tr>      <tr>         <td width="50%">demo.c</td>        <td width="50%">Code for launching graphics routines and controlling them           with the joystick.</td>      </tr>      <tr>         <td width="50%">demo.h</td>        <td width="50%">Common typedefs, prototypes, and variable declarations.</td>      </tr>      <tr>         <td width="50%">Makefile</td>        <td width="50%">MAKEFILE for building and running sample program.</td>      </tr>      <tr>         <td width="50%">mandel\*.*</td>        <td width="50%">Assembly language code for the Mandelbrot demo.</td>      </tr>      <tr>         <td width="50%">menu.c</td>        <td width="50%">Code for displaying help screens and menus.</td>      </tr>      <tr>         <td width="50%">ray\*.*</td>        <td width="50%">Assembly language code for Raytrace 1 demo.</td>      </tr>      <tr>         <td width="50%">raybox\*.*</td>        <td width="50%">Assembly language code for Raytrace 2 demo.</td>      </tr>      <tr>         <td width="50%">sky.s</td>        <td width="50%">Assembly language code for sky background for menus.</td>      </tr>    </table>  </center></div><p>&nbsp;</p>		<hr>	</body></html>
