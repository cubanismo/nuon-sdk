<p align="left">This is an implementation of the game of life invented by 
John H. Conway.  This description is from Scientific American
April 1999 p. 41 42 by Mark Alpert : "In the game, you start with a
pattern of checkers on the grid -- these
represent the 'live' cells.  You then remove each checker that has one
or no neighboring checkers or four or more neighbors (these cells
'die' from loneliness or overcrowding).  Checkers with two or three
neighbors remain on the board.  In addition, new cells are 'born' -- a
checker is added to each empty space that is adjacent to exactly three
checkers.  By applying these rules repeatedly, one can create an
amazing variety of Life forms, including 'gliders' and 'spaceships'
that steadily move across the grid."</p>

<p align="left">In this VMLabs implementation, a trial stops when the number of 
  live cells drops below a threshold. The age of an active cell is shown by its 
  color. Each new trial uses a square for active cells.</p>
 
<p align="left">The cells are displayed in the main plane. A translucent
rectangle with the word NUON is overlaid in the graphics plane.</p>
