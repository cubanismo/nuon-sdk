RELEASE NOTES FOR THE OZ->ARIES TRANSITION
VERSION: $Id: OzToAries.txt,v 1.1 2000/10/11 22:33:07 cheiny Exp $

For those developers who are makign the transition from a development system with the OZ
chip revision to a system with the new ARIES revision, there are a number of differences
to note:


(1) Only 8 MB of EDO RAM is accessible with the rev 4 board and the default compiler setup. 

	The problem is that the first 8 MB of memory appears twice, and then the second 8 MB
	appears twice. This is a hardware bug that is fixed on rev 5 boards.

	Thus, to use all 16 MB in an application, you will have to link using the flags:

	-Xlinker -B -Xlinker 0x80800000

	this will offset the usual start address by 8mb so that you may access all
	16 megabytes contiguously.


(2) Video hardware has changed.

	Much old video code will not work properly with Aries. 

	You must use the BIOS calls (or the libmutil VidSetup call, which ends up
	calling the BIOS) to set up video on Aries.

	Please note that this means that many older demos will not work properly on
	an ARIES machine.


(3) Audio hardware has changed.

	You will need new audio libraries for Aries.  Unfortunately, we cannot efficiently create
	audio libraries which will work on both Oz and Aries.

	The current SDK includes separate audio libraries for OZ and ARIES.  The end of the
	library name is appended with either "_oz" or "_aries" to indicate which chip
	is appropriate for that library.

	If you link an application with the wrong library, you won't get any sound.
