  An Introduction to NUON Assembly Language</big></a></span></p>
<p><span class="Text"><big>This document discusses step by step the process of 
  creating an assembly language module, getting it working properly, and then 
  optimizing it to the fastest, smallest code possible.</big></span></p>
<p><span class="Text"><big><strong><font color="#FF0000">IMPORTANT NOTE</font></strong><font color="#800000"> 
  - The video setup routine used by the source code that accompanies this tutorial 
  is not compatible with Aries-based hardware.&nbsp; This code was originally 
  written before the BIOS code was available, so it includes its own code for 
  things like video setup and other tasks now handled by the BIOS.&nbsp; Unfortunately 
  because things such as the video interface have changed since those very early 
  days, this code does not work properly on Aries-based hardware.</font></big></span></p>
<p><span class="Text"><font color="#800000"><big>We hope to have the sample code 
  updated soon, but for now you will not be able to execute the code on Aries-based 
  hardware.&nbsp; However, in the meantime, the optimization principles discussed 
  in the tutorial still apply.</big></font></span></p>

<p><span class="Text"><big>This document discusses Jeff Minter's OBJECT LIST RENDERER, 
  a sophisticated object management system used to manage 2D sprites and automatically 
  handle simple to moderately complex animation.</big></span></p>

  the Object List Renderer which is written in C and which does use the BIOS code 
  where appropriate.&nbsp; This sample may be found in the \VMLABS\SAMPLE\OLRDEMO 
  directory.&nbsp; This code should work on Aries-based machines.</big></span></p>
