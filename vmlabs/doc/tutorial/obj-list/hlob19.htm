<H1>High-Level Object Example 9</H1><P>

To set up for this example, at the top of ol_demo2.a, make sure that you have "initlist = cloud_initlist".
Assemble and run the code.  You should see a nice cloud-style background warpy layer, on top of which there
are a number of spaceships.  Move the joystick and press the primary FIRE button, and you should see that all
the ships have their own handling characteristics.  The objective of the next set of examples is to show how
to use the Command String to encode joystick-responsive behaviour into an Object.<P>
