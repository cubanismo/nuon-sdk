BIOS Version</a></h1>

<p><big>There is a sample program in the SDK that can print out information
regarding the BIOS version that is currently installed.&nbsp; Go to the
directory:</big></p>
<p><big>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \VMLABS\SAMPLE\DIAGNOSTIC\SYSINFO</big></p>
<p><big>And enter the command &quot;</big><big><b>gmake load</b>&quot;.&nbsp; If
your system is configured correctly, the program will be built if needed, and
then it will execute.&nbsp; If everything works right, you'll get a display on
your TV screen with text showing the current BIOS version.</big></p>
<p><big>If you have difficulty building or running the </big><big><b>sysinfo</b>
program, please make sure that your system is properly configured.&nbsp; Refer
to the <b><a href="../Hitchhikers.PDF"><i>Hitchhiker's Guide To NUON</i></a></b>
document for information.</big></p>

<h1 align="center"><a name="Boot/BIOS ROM -VS- &quot;The Stub&quot;">Boot/BIOS ROM -VS- &quot;The Stub&quot;</a></h1>

<p><big>Before you update anything, please make sure you understand the
difference between the two parts of your NUON development system which use FLASH
ROM.&nbsp; They are:</big>
<ul>
  <li><big>Boot ROM / BIOS ROM -- The NUON development system has a 4mb Flash
    ROM built into the motherboard.&nbsp; The motherboard also has a socket for
    a ROM or EPROM.&nbsp; A jumper (labeled &quot;Flash&quot; and
    &quot;ROM&quot;) selects which one of these is active.&nbsp; (Normally it's
    set to FLASH).<br>
    <br>
    This is what we usually mean when we refer to the &quot;Flash&quot;, the
    &quot;Flash ROM&quot;, the &quot;Boot ROM&quot; or &quot;firmware&quot;.<br>
    <br>
    This Flash ROM contains the BIOS (if a ROM BIOS is installed) as well as
    whatever startup code is installed.&nbsp; Older versions of the NUON startup
    code displayed color bars or a NUON logo graphic.&nbsp; Some more recent
    versions would draw an animated fractal image.&nbsp; The current version
    shows a NUON logo and text prompts that allow you to go to a system
    configuration menu or the DVD player.<br>
    <br>
    The boot code does not really interact with the stub.&nbsp; The BIOS only
    interacts to the degree that the stub may occasionally download a small
    piece of code to do some debugging function or to speed up a data transfer.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    </big></li>
  <li><big>Debug / Ethernet Interface Card -- The debug card in your development
    system uses a flash ROM so that the debugging stub may be updated when
    needed.&nbsp; However, as a general rule, the NUON documentation does not
    refer to this as &quot;flash ROM&quot;.&nbsp; Instead, we normally refer to
    this simply as the &quot;stub&quot;.&nbsp; We would say &quot;update your
    stub&quot; instead of &quot;update your debug card flash ROM&quot;.<br>
    <br>
    The debug card contains a PowerPC 860 processor, and most of the code on the
    stub's ROM is intended for that processor, not the NUON chip on the
    motherboard.&nbsp; This code does not have anything to do with the BIOS or
    the startup code, except that it must safely co-exist on those occasions
    when it must ask one of the NUON processor's MPEs to do something.&nbsp; In
    those cases, it may download a small piece of code to an MPE to facilitate
    some debugging function, or to speed up transfers over the Ethernet
    interface.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    Please see &quot;<a href="update_stub.html">Updating Your Stub</a>&quot;
    for information on how to update your stub.<br>

<p align="center"><b><font color="#FF0000">NOTE: </font></b><font color="#FF0000">These
instructions only apply to updates dated February 13, 2001 or later.</font>

<p><big>The ROM-based BIOS and startup boot code for your Revision 5.x system may be
updated by following the instructions below.&nbsp; Please note that if you have
just received a NUON development system, it is probably not necessary for you to
update it right away.</big> 

<ol>
  <li><big>Make sure your SDK is properly installed and that your <b> MD_PORT</b> environment variable
    is set correctly.<br>
    </big></li>
  <li><big>Change to the <b><i>VMLABS\BIOS Update </i></b>directory.<br>
    </big></li>
  <li><big>Reset your development system and wait for the reset process to complete.<br>
    </big></li>
  <li><big>For NTSC-based systems, execute the </big><big><b>UPDATE-NTSC.BAT</b>
    batch file.<br>
    </big></li>
  <li><big>For PAL-based systems, execute the </big><big><b>UPDATE-PAL.BAT </b>batch
    file.</big></li>
</ol>

<p><big>These steps will result in a program being downloaded to your development system,
followed by the data to be programmed into the FLASH ROM.&nbsp; Your development system's
display will indicate the current status of the update through a progress
bar.&nbsp; Once the update is completed, a message will be shown and you can
then reset your system.</big>

Firmware Release:</a></font></h1>

<ul>
  <li><big>This version of the NUON BIOS no longer supports the
    original-style prototype game controllers.&nbsp; These are the Nintendo 64
    shells with a DB-25 cable that connect to a small black interface box, which
    in turn connects to the NUON development system using a DB-9 cable.<br>
    <br>
    It is now required that you use a production controller.&nbsp; Using a small
    adapter cable, this type of controller connects to the USB-style ports on
    the back of the NUON development system.&nbsp; (Note that these are not
    actually USB ports... it's just the same kind of connector.)<br>
    <br>
    If you do not have an actual production-style game controller, we recommend
    that&nbsp; you do not update your BIOS until you obtain one.<br>
    </big></li>
  <li><big>If you're using PAL mode, there are some known problems:<br>
    </big>
    <ul>
      <li><big>DVD movies will not play, although the menu still says to &quot;<i>Press
        'A' For DVD Player</i>&quot;<br>
        </big></li>
      <li><big>If you run the update procedure again, the display may not be
        configured properly while the update is in progress.&nbsp; However, this
        will not affect the update.&nbsp; This will be fixed in a future
        release.</big></li>
    </ul>
  </li>

<h1 align="center">Synth Wavetable Data</h1>

<p><big>Revision 5.x machines are equipped with a Flash ROM.&nbsp; In the past,
it was common practice to download the
wavetable data used by the NUON SYNTH library to this Flash ROM, where it would be
available at all times.&nbsp; </big><p><big>This was done largely because the
original plan was to include the wavetable data in the ROM of production
machines.&nbsp; However, this plan changed because we determined that the
majority of games will not use MIDI.&nbsp; Rather they will use streaming audio
from disc for music.&nbsp; This fact made it hard to justify devoting so much
ROM space to the SYNTH wavetable data when that space could be used by other
things.&nbsp; Plus, since that original plan was made, the minimum RAM size of a
NUON player has increased from 4mb to 16mb, so it just seemed like a better idea
to RAM-load the data when necessary.</big><p>&nbsp;
