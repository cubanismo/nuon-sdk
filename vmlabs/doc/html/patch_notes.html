<P><big>The following changes have been made to the patches for the SDK .86.2 
  release.</P>
<P>(1) Made the new MiniBIOS patch apply to Extiva2 systems (this fixes a problem 
  where if there was a lot of DMAs going on in the system _MediaRead could get 
  bad data but not report an error). </P>
<P>(2) Re-enabled the dual layer patch code for Toshiba SD2300 systems. </P>
<P>(3) Added a sanity check to the _MediaRead timeout code to avoid a NULL pointer 
  access (for both Toshiba SD2300 and Extiva1 systems). </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The following changes have been made to the patches for the SDK .86 release.</big></P>
<p><big>(1) Patched a handle leak in _MediaOpen which was causing Extiva1 systems 
  to run out of media handles after 8 _MediaOpen/_MediaClose calls (basically 
  each _MediaOpen used up 2 handles, and _MediaClose restored only 1). </big></p>
<p><big>(2) Moved a number of patches out of the application area and into the 
  BIOS patch space, so that they can survive reset and will work correctly with 
  code overlays. </big></p>
<p><big>(3) Extended the range available for _ControllerPollRate on older systems 
  from 0-15 to 0-1023, and fixed some bugs in the implementation of this patch 
  on Extiva-1 and SD2300. </big></p>
<p><big>(4) Disabled a layer 2 patch on the Toshiba SD2300. Dual layer discs may 
  not work correctly with this version of crt0.o on the SD2300. The dual layer 
  patch was causing Iron Soldier not to boot correctly on the SD2300, even on 
  single-layer discs. </big></p>
<p><big>(5) Fixed a chroma display problem with MPEG pixel displays on the Toshiba 
  SD2300, Extiva1, and Extiva2. </big></p>
