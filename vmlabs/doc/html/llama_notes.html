<h1 align="center">Llama Assembler Notes</h1>

<hr>
<big>
<P>The following changes have been made to Llama in recent versions.</P>
<h3>Llama 2.69 improvements:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>The code generation now emits "sub #N,r0" instead of "add #-N,r0" when 
      N is a small integer constant and when the results of the carry bit are 
      not used later. (And similarly "add #N,r0" can be used instead of "sub #-N,r0".) 
      This means that a long (48 bit) instruction can be replaced with a 16 or 
      32 bit instruction.<br>
 </li>
    <li>The optimizer now understands that "mvr" and some forms of "st_io" are 
      equivalent, and will switch between them when this results in better code.<br>
    </li>
    <li>The mvr instruction no longer accepts xybase, xyrange, and xyctl as destination 
      registers.</li>
</ul>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h3>Llama 2.70 improvements:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Optimizer code would write the wrong instruction of a pair into the 
        instruction stream. For example, it would try to turn "mvr" into "st_io", 
        but accidentally write "mvr" instead and then next time through it would 
        try to repeat the same thing, resulting in an infinite loop.</li>
    </ul>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h3>Llama 2.71 improvements:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Added "-chip N" option to specify alpha, oz, or aries, and made default 
        aries (it used to be oz).<br>
 </li>
      <li>When assembling for aries, generate "dec_only" instruction instead of 
        synthetic "addr #0,rx" as a placeholder RCU instruction.</li>
    </ul>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h3>Llama 2.72 improvements:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Added code to "pull back" instructions to fill nops that are left after 
        optimization. </li>
    </ul>
<ul>
    <li>Added a second pass to replace longer instructions with shorter, equivalent 
      alternate forms.<br>
 </li>
    <li>Used the "pull back" code to replace dec_only instructions where possible 
      (by pulling back a register unit instruction to hold the dec).</li>
</ul>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h3>Llama 2.73</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Extended .lcomm and .comm directives with an optional alignment parameter.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Extended the built in linking process so that .comm works with the built 
        in linker. </li>
    </ul>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h3>Llama 2.74</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Fixed definition of st_s for rx,ry,ru,rv so it is properly noted as 
        a local store.<br>
 </li>
      <li>Extended the optimizer's "instruction pullback to fill nops" stage to 
        also look for alternate forms of instructions to pull back. </li>
    </ul>
</big> 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><big><font size="+1"><b>Llama 2.75</b></font></p>
<ul>
  <li>Added new warnings 
    <ul>
      <li>"alignment > 32768 not officially supported"</li>
      <li>"instruction has no effect" </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Fixed the "section symbols" in COFF files, which frequently had trailing 
    garbage after them.</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug in the optimizer where it would sometimes select alternate forms 
    of instructions which are shorter but which have side effects which are dangerous 
    in that location.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><font size="+1">Llama 2.76</font></b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Symbolic labels are now allowed in the expression which limits an overlay 
    or section size.</li>
  <li>If a jmp or jsr that was assumed to be in local memory doesn't fit in a 
    32 bit instruction, the longer jmp/jsr forms are tried.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><font size="+1">Llama 2.77</font></b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Added directives for unaligned short and word-sized data.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><font size="+1">Llama 2.78</font></b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Fixed instruction analysis of bra ,nop instructions occuring in delay slots. 
  </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><font size="+1">Llama 2.79</font></b></p>
<ul>
  <li> Catch out of range addresses in st_s #nnnn,labelD instructions.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><font size="+1">Llama 2.80</font></b></p>
<ul>
  <li>No longer emits spurious warnings about instructions with no effect.</li>
</ul>
