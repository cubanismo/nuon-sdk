<hr>

<p><big>Some changes to the system include files have been made.&nbsp; These
changes include:</big></p>

<ul>
  <li><big>The Audio library configuration has changed.&nbsp; Instead of
    LIBMAUD1 and LIBMAUD2, we now have LIBSYNTH and LIBNISE.&nbsp; The LIBSYNTH
    library contains the synthesizer and non-streaming PCM functions.&nbsp; The
    LIBNISE library contains the non-streaming PCM functions as well as
    streaming audio functions.<br>
    <br>
    The changes to the libraries are not very drastic.&nbsp; It should be simple
    to change existing code.&nbsp; Instead of including PCMAPI.H, you should now
    include NISE.H.&nbsp; See <a href="../Audio/GameAudio.pdf">GAMEAUDIO.PDF</a> for
    documentation.<br>
    <br>
    </big></li>
  <li><big>A number of separate include files for various portions of the MML2D
    library have been combined into a single large MML2D.H include file.&nbsp;
    These files are:<br>
    <br>
    </big><big>M2PUB.H<br>
    M2TYPES.H<br>
    MLCOLOR.H<br>
    MLPIXMAP.H<br>
    MLTEXT.H<br>
    MLTYPES.H<br>
    <br>
    References to any of these files should be replaced with a single reference
    to the MML2D.H file.&nbsp; Please note that failing to make this change is
    not fatal.&nbsp; The older files have been modified to include MML2D.H and
    display a warning that your source should be updated.</big>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
  <li><big>The BIOS.H include file has been modified to automatically include
    all of the BIOS-related include files so that they no longer need be listed
    individually. However, aside from BIOS.H, the individual files have not been
    modified.&nbsp;&nbsp; The BIOS.H file now automatically includes:<br>
    <br>
    </big><big>MPE.H<br>
    COMM.H<br>
    CACHE.H<br>
    AUDIO.H<br>
    VIDEO.H<br>
    JOYSTICK.H<br>
    TIME.H<br>
    MEDIAIO.H<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    </big><big><br>
    </big>
  </li>
</ul>
