<p><a href="../tutorial/optimize/llama.htm"><big>Optimizing Your Llama: An Introduction
to NUON Assembly Language </big></a></p>

<p><big>This document discusses step by step the process of creating an assembly language
module, getting it working properly, and then optimizing it to the fastest, smallest code
possible.</big></p>

<p><big><strong><font color="#FF0000">IMPORTANT NOTE</font></strong><font color="#800000">
- The video setup routine used by the source code that accompanies this tutorial is not
compatible with Aries-based hardware.&nbsp; This code was originally written before the
BIOS code was available, so it includes its own code for things like video setup and other
tasks now handled by the BIOS.&nbsp; Unfortunately because things such as the video
interface have changed since those very early days, this code does not work properly on
Aries-based hardware.</font></big></p>

<p><font color="#800000"><big>We hope to have the sample code updated soon, but for now
you will not be able to execute the code on Aries-based hardware.&nbsp; However, in the
meantime, the optimization principles discussed in the tutorial still apply.</big></font></p>

<p><a href="../tutorial/obj-list/index.htm"><big>Object List Programming by Jeff Minter</big></a></p>

<p><big>This document discusses Jeff Minter's OBJECT LIST RENDERER, a sophisticated object
management system used to manage 2D sprites and automatically handle simple to moderately
complex animation.</big></p>

<p><big>Please note that we do have another sample which uses the Object List Renderer
which is written in C and which does use the BIOS code where appropriate.&nbsp; This
sample may be found in the \VMLABS\SAMPLE\OLRDEMO directory.&nbsp; This code should work
on Aries-based machines.</big></p>
