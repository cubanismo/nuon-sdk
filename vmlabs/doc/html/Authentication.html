<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h3>What Is Authentication?</h3>
<p>Authentication is the process that ensures that only authorized versions of 
  your software run on NUON enhanced products.</p>
<h3>What Happens</h3>
<p>Authentication consists of two parts: <b><i>blessing</i></b> the application, 
  which is done by VM Labs, and <b><i>authenticating</i></b> the application, 
  which is done by the NUON enhanced product whenever the application is loaded.</p>
<h4>Blessing</h4>
<p>The during the blessing process, information is added to your application in 
  an encrypted format. This information is used at load time to verify that the 
  application being loaded is authorized to run on that particular product.</p>
<p>Some sanity checks and additional processing are also executed during the blessing 
  process. These include:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Checking to ensure that the application is loaded into MPE3.</b> Virtually 
    all NUON applications are written with the expectation that they will be executing 
    on MPE3. If the <span class="Filename">.cof</span> file headers specify that 
    the application is to be loaded into an MPE other than MPE3, a warning is 
    written to the authentication log. The application will still be bless, however 
    it may not actually run when it is loaded. If you are experiencing load time 
    crashes of your application, check the authentication log that was returned 
    to you at the time the application was blessed.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li><b>Padding the application. </b>A few early NUON products have a bug in 
    the authentication code that will cause the system to crash if the amount 
    of application information to be processed is 8 bytes less than an integral 
    multiple of 64 bytes. This problem is known as the &quot;fencepost&quot; problem, 
    and is fixed in almost all NUON enhanced products produced after September 
    2000.<br>
    <br>
    The fix for this problem is to pad all applications to contain an integral 
    multiple of 64 bytes of loadable information. This is done by introducing 
    a new section (named <span class="Filename">bless_p</span>) into the coff 
    file which pads it out to the correct size. Although this section contains 
    loadable 0x00 bytes, it is overlaid by your <span class="Filename">.bss</span> 
    section at load time, and thus does not actually occupy any extra memory. 
    Files that already contain an integral multiple of 64 bytes of information 
    will not be padded. <br>
    <br>
    <font color="#CC0033"><b><font size="+1">Warning!</font> </b></font>If your 
    application does not have a <span class="Filename">.bss</span> section, the 
    current blessing process cannot pad your file. If this is the case, a warning 
    message will be placed in the authentication log file. If your application 
    cannot be padded and is one that triggers the fencepost problem, a notification 
    that it will not run on early NUON systems will be placed in the authentication 
    log file. The workaround for this is to manually add some bytes (16 will typically 
    be enough) to your loadable data and have the file blessed again. This restriction 
    will be removed with a future SDK release.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Authenticating</h4>
<p>Authenticating is the process of checking your application when it is loaded 
  into a NUON enhanced system. This consists of two parts:</p>
<ol>
  <li>decrypting the blessings</li>
  <li>checking the contents of the <span class="Filename">.cof</span> file against 
    the blessings.</li>
</ol>
<p>If the file loading firmware detects a mismatch between the blessings and the 
  other contents of the file, the application will not be loaded and the DVD media 
  will be ejected.</p>
<h3>Getting an application blessed</h3>
<p>When you submit an application to VM Labs for blessing, it will usually be 
  turned around with in one business day. You will receive 3 or 4 files back, 
  depending on whether the application was padded during the blessing process. 
  These files are:</p>
<table width="75%" border="0">
  <tr class="TableHeading"> 
    <td>Filename</td>
    <td>What it contains</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td class="Filename" valign="top"> 
      <div align="right"><i>appname</i>.cof</div>
    </td>
    <td>Your original application.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td class="Filename" valign="top"> 
      <div align="right"><i>appname</i>.cof.padded</div>
    </td>
    <td><b>Optional</b>. If your application required padding (see above), this 
      file is generated. It contains your original application, plus an additional 
      section required to achieve the correct application size.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td class="Filename" valign="top"> 
      <div align="right"><i>appname</i>.cof.app</div>
    </td>
    <td>The blessed application.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td class="Filename" valign="top"> 
      <div align="right"><i>appname</i>.cof.auth</div>
    </td>
    <td>The authentication log for the application. This contains useful information 
      as described in the following section.</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>Thus if you submit the application <span class="Filename">pong.cof</span>, 
  you could expect to receive the files <span class="Filename">pong.cof</span>, 
  <span class="Filename">pong.cof.padded</span> (if padding was needed), <span class="Filename">pong.cof.app</span>, 
  and <span class="Filename">pong.cof.auth</span>.</p>
<h4>The authentication log</h4>
<p>The authentication log file contains important information about your blessed 
  application. <b>You should always check this file for any error or warning messages 
  relating to your application.</b> The following information is contained in 
  the authentication log:</p>
<ul>
  <li>the date/time the file was blessed;</li>
  <li>the name of the file being blessed;</li>
  <li>the version of the blessing application;</li>
  <li>(optional) warning messages if the application is targeted to an MPE other 
    than MPE3;</li>
  <li>(optional) information about padding;</li>
  <li>(optional) warning messages if the file required padding but could not be 
    padded; </li>
  <li>(optional) for non-padded files, a warning if the application will encounter 
    the fencepost problem;</li>
  <li>the name of the file that was actually blessed (either <span class="Filename"><i>appname</i>.cof</span> 
    or <span class="Filename"><i>appname</i>.cof.padded</span>);</li>
  <li>the name of the encryption key used;</li>
  <li>the application type (either game or hybrid);</li>
  <li>checksum info for: 
    <ol>
      <li>the file that was blessed; and</li>
      <li>the <span class="Filename">.cof </span>contents of the <span class="Filename"><i>appname</i>.cof.app</span> 
        file.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The checksum information is a 32-bit CRC generated using the Linux <span class="Filename">cksum</span> 
  utility (available under Windows as part of the MKS toolkit). This information 
  can be used to verify that the contents of the file are correct. </p>
<h3>The <font size="-1"><span class="Filename">authinfo</span></font> application 
</h3>
<p>The <span class="Filename">authinfo</span> application dumps some basic information 
  about an authenticated application. <span class="Filename">authinfo</span> can 
  also be used extract the blessed <span class="Filename">.cof</span> file from 
  the authenticated application. It runs on both Windows and Linux platforms. 
  More information is available in the <a href="./authinfo.html"><i>authinfo</i> 
  documentation</a>.</p>
