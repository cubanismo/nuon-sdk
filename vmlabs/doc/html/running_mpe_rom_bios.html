<h1 align="center">Running on MPE 3 With the ROM-Based BIOS</h1>

<p><big>If you started your NUON development back in ancient times when the BIOS
was a library linked with your application, some changes may be necessary in
order to make your program work with this SDK release.</big></p>

<p><big>As of February 2000, the standard system has used a ROM-based
BIOS.&nbsp; On a development system, this is contained in the flash ROM on your
motherboard.</big>&nbsp; <big>If you don't already have the current version of
the ROM BIOS installed in your motherboard's flash ROM, then you will need to update
your system.&nbsp; Please see </big><big><a href="update_flashrom.html">Installing the ROM-Based BIOS</a>
for instructions.</big></p>

<p><big>Another change that was made at the same time is that we are now using
MPE 3 as the primary processor, rather than MPE 0.&nbsp; Some simple programs
may require nothing more than a few changes to their build process in order to
work, but chances are that additional changes are needed.&nbsp; The information
below will help you begin the process.&nbsp; If you require additional
assistance, please <a href="contacts.html">contact VM Labs Developer Support</a>.</big></p>

<hr>

<h1 align="center">Compiling Your Code</h1>

<p><big>Compiling your code normally requires no changes in order to target MPE 3.&nbsp;
However, some changes may be required to target the ROM-based BIOS
properly.&nbsp; See <a href="#Running Your Code">Running Your Code</a> below.</big></p>

<p><big>You must make some changes in order to link your final executable
correctly.</big></p>
<hr>
<h1 align="center">Linking Your Code</h1>

<p><big>In order to target MPE 3, do the following:</big></p>
<ul>
  <li><big>Add the option &quot;<font color="#0000FF">-mpe3</font>&quot; to your
    MGCC command line.&nbsp; This is only needed for linking.<br>
    </big></li>
</ul>
<p><big>In order to target a ROM-based BIOS, do the following:</big></p>
<ul>
  <li><big>Remove references to &quot;-lbios&quot; or LIBBIOS.A from your
    compile and link commands.<br>
    </big></li>
  <li><big>Add the </big><big>option &quot;<font color="#0000FF">-mrom</font>&quot;
    to your MGCC command line.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is only needed for linking.</big></li>
</ul>
<p><big><br>
If you are not using MGCC to drive your link, we suggest you compile and link a
sample program using the &quot;-v&quot; option so that you can see what changes
you need to make to your linker command.</big></p>
<hr>
<h1 align="center"><a name="Running Your Code">Running Your Code</a></h1>
<p><big>Running a program on MPE 3 with the ROM BIOS is a little different than
with a program linked against a RAM-based BIOS for MPE 0.</big></p>
<p><big>First of all, the ROM BIOS is already running when you download your
program.&nbsp; This means that special steps must be taken in order to avoid
stepping on the BIOS.</big></p>
<ul>
  <li><big>Do not specify internal MPE memory as a load address.&nbsp; Anything
    loaded to internal memory should be copied over at runtime, not loaded
    directly into that memory because you've linked your program file that way.<br>
    </big></li>
  <li><big>Please note that there is not much internal memory on MPE 3 available
    to applications, since it is mostly used by the BIOS and the cache.&nbsp;
    See the BIOS documentation for information on obtaining a temporary scratch
    buffer in internal MPE memory.<br>
    </big></li>
  <li><big>Add &quot;-n&quot; to your MLOAD command line, following the
    &quot;-p3&quot; option.&nbsp; This tells MLOAD that a ROM-based BIOS is
    already executing so that it can avoid corrupting it.<br>
    </big></li>
  <li><big>If you do not explicitly tell MLOAD which processor is the target for
    a load, then it automatically selects MPE 0.&nbsp; In order to load onto MPE
    3, you must always explicitly add &quot;-p3&quot; to your MLOAD command
    line.</big></li>
</ul>
<p><big>A sample command line for MLOAD to download and execute on MPE 3 is:</big></p>
<blockquote>
  <h4 align="center"><big>mload -! -w -w -w -w -p3 -n file.cof -r</big></h4>
</blockquote>
<p align="left"><big>This tells MLOAD to reset the machine, wait 4 seconds (1
second for each &quot;-w&quot;), target MPE 3, avoid corrupting the BIOS, download &quot;file.cof&quot;, and then
start MPE 3.&nbsp;</big></p>
<hr>
<h1 align="center">Loading Old Code Onto MPE 0</h1>
<p align="left"><big>Loading old code on to MPE 0 with a RAM-based BIOS is still
possible, even after you have installed the ROM BIOS.&nbsp; However, because the
ROM BIOS is now running on your system, you do have to make a few changes to the
procedure for loading.</big></p>
<p align="left"><big>Without the ROM BIOS, you would download and run a program
using a command line like one of these:</big></p>
<h4 align="center"><big>mload file.cof -r<br>
mload -p0 file.cof -r -fs<br>
mload -! -w file.cof -r<br>
mload -! -w -p0 file.cof -r -fs</big></h4>
<p align="left"><big>After installing the ROM BIOS, you should change those
command lines to look like this:</big></p>
<h4 align="center"><big>mload </big><big>-p3 -h -p0 </big><big>file.cof -r<br>
mload </big><big>-p3 -h </big><big>-p0 file.cof -r -fs<br>
mload -! -w </big><big>-p3 -h -p0 </big><big>file.cof -r<br>
mload -! -w </big><big>-p3 -h -p0 </big><big>file.cof -r -fs</big></h4>
<p align="left"><big>The main change we've made is that we always specify MPE 3
and then halt execution on that processor before we do anything else, with the
exception of reset.&nbsp; Since a reset would restart the ROM BIOS code, we
always do that first.&nbsp; Also, because we've previously specified MPE 3 as a
target, we must always explicitly specify MPE 0 as a target for the command that
come after that.</big></p>
