vmdump - coff file display and convertion

vmdump is an ad hoc tool for generating certain views of a coff
file. Most of it's functionality will be moved to vmld.

Invocation

	vmdump option dataspec:file ...

vmdump applies the action specified by "option" to a "dataspec"
portion of a coff file. For most options, the dataspec is a
comma-separated list of section names, or symbol names, as
appropriate. For --snap option (see below) a dataspec is a
requested memory range.

Either long or short option format is supported.

vmdump supports the following opitons:

-h (--headers) sect[,sect...]:file
	Displays general section information (similar to coffdump -h)

-s (--symbols) sym[,sym...]:file
	Displays symbolic information (similar to coffdump -s)

-d (--debugging) sym[,sym...]:file
	Displays extended symbolic information

(The following options generate the binary output)

-T (--symtab) sym[,sym...]:file
	Generates the coff file consisting of just a linkable
	symbol table

-S (--Srecord) sect[,sect...]:file
	Generates contents of listed sections as an S-record file

-B (--bin)
	Dumps a pure contents of listed sections as a binary file

-P (--snap) start,size:file
	Dumps a pure contents of a _memory range_ (including
	inter-section gaps) as a binary file.
