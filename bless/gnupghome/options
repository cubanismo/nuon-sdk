# Options for GnuPG
#
# Unless you you specify which option file to use (with the
# commandline option "--options filename"), GnuPG uses the
# file ~/.gnupg/options by default.
#
# An option file can contain all long options which are
# available in GnuPG. If the first non white space character of
# a line is a '#', this line is ignored.  Empty lines are also
# ignored.
#
# See the man page for a list of options.

# Uncomment the next line to get rid of the copyright notice
#no-greeting

# If you have more than 1 secret key in your keyring, you may want
# to uncomment the following option and set your preffered keyid

#default-key 621CC013

# If you do not pass a recipient to gpg, it will ask for one.
# Using this option you can encrypt to a default key.  key validation
# will not be done in this case.
# The second form uses the default key as default recipient.

#default-recipient some-user-id
#default-recipient-self


# The next option is enabled because this one is needed for interoperation
# with PGP 5 users.  To enable full OpenPGP compliance you have to remove
# this option.

force-v3-sigs

# Because some mailers change lines starting with "From " to ">From "
# it is good to handle such lines in a special way when creating
# cleartext signatures; all other PGP versions it this way too.
# To enable full OpenPGP compliance you have to remove this option.

escape-from-lines

# If you do not use the Latin-1 (ISO-8859-1) charset, you should
# tell GnuPG which is the native character set.  Please check
# the man page for supported character sets.
#charset koi8-r


# You may define aliases like this:
#   alias mynames  -u 0x12345678 -u 0x456789ab -z 9
# everytime you use --mynames, it will be expanded to the options
# in the above defintion.  The name of the alias may not be abbreviated.
# NOTE: This is not yet implemented

# lock the file only once for the lifetime of a process.
# if you do not define this, the lock will be obtained and released
# every time it is needed - normally this is not needed.
lock-once

# If you have configured GnuPG without a random gatherer
# (./configure --enable-static-rnd=none), you have to
# uncomment _one_ of the following lines.  These
# extensions won't get used if you have a random gatherer
# compiled in (which is the default for GNU and xxxBSD systems)
#load-extension rndlinux
#load-extension rndunix
#load-extension rndegd


# GnuPG can import a key from a HKP keyerver if one is missing
# for sercain operations. Is you set this option to a keyserver
# you will be asked in such a case whether GnuPG should try to
# import the key from that server (server do syncronize with each
# others and DNS Round-Robin may give you a random server each time).
# Use "host -l pgp.net | grep www" to figure out a keyserver.
#keyserver wwwkeys.eu.pgp.net
